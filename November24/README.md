# November 24 Assignment

#### Project Idea

For this week's communications project, I decided to modify the game I  had developed for our midterm project. You can find a more detailed explanation of how the game works [here](https://github.com/AalyaSharaf/intro-to-IM/blob/master/midtermProject/README.md). Previously the game was controlled using the arrows keys or the 'a' & 'd' keys, now the new and modified version is controlled using the ultrasonic (distance) sensor in order to move from left to right. 

#### Probelms/ Issues

To be honest I struggled with the idea of communications much more than I expected. A lot of the issues I ran into just came form a lack of understanding of the concept, it was just a difficult one to grasp for me. That is why I decided to focus all my energy on the communications aspect of the project rather than the game designing. I spent a lot of time rewatching class recordings, watching yotube videos, and entering arduino forums to see solutions to similar problems peoplemay have ran into. I found that the forums specifically helped a lot with troubleshooting and helped me recognize any silly mistakes I may have made. The combination of these resources helped me gain a better understanding of the concept and I was able to successfully implement communications between my arduino and my processing game.
