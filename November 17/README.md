# November 17 Assignment

#### Project Idea & Schematic

My project this week is inspires by radios! At first I had wanted to create a digital keyboard of sorts, that used 3 momentary switches as "piano keys". I felt that it wasn't that hard to do and I wanted to work on something that would challenge me more. My project consists of an on and off toggle switch for the radio, and a potentiometer to control which tunes come on. Click here for a video of the project
