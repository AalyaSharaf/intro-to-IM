# Project Idea

I dont have the specifics of my project figured out yet, but I know that I want to use arduino to communicate to a game on processing. I want the communication to be two way so that both arduino and processing are communicating with each other. The controls would be on arduino while feedback from the actual game would be communicated to different things connected to the arduino board.
