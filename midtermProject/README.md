# Midterm Project

### Game Description & Instructions


### My Progress/ Different Game Stages

#### Stage 1
- Attached below is a video of how I started my project. A plain black screen that transitioned into the game screen when the mouse was pressed. On the game screen was a simple spaceship design that was controlled by the position of mouseX.

#### Stage 2
- The next step was adding a space background that further enhanced the theme of the game. 
- I also created an array of meteorites to be falling from the sky, the only issue being that it would appear in the same place with the same size and speed over & over again. My goal was to have them appear randomly (in shape, size and position)

#### Stage 3
- I modified it so that the spaceship is being controlled by keys rather than the position of mouseX.
- The meteorites now fall from the sky at random positions with different sizes & speeds everytime
- At this stage, the game has no way to end or reach the game over screen.

#### Stage 4
- In this stage, I added barriers to prevent the spaceship from going off screen 
- I implemented collisions so that the game would end whenever a meteorite would hit the spaceship
- I added hearts on the screen (for game lives), but they don't work in this stage
- I also changed how the meteorites look.

#### Stage 5
- In this stage, the game lives work so you have 3 lives before the game is over. I added red flashed that appear on the screen to warn you that you have lost a life.
- I added SciFi background music and gave the player the choice to either mute or unmute it based on their preference. 
- I also added some images for design purposes
