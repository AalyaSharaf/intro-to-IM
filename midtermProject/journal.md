# Midterm Project Journal

(Add brief project description)

#### October 18,2020
- Since I don't have a fixed idea for my game yet, I decided to work on the skeleton of the code. I worked on the details that related to the separate game screens; the home page, the game screen, and a way to restart the game without restarting the program itself.
- I have never attempted to work with multiple game screens so trying to figure out the correct way to use the if statements and what not was a bit confusing at first, but I eventually figured it out through trial and error and a bit of research.
