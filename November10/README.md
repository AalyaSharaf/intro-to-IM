# November 10 Assignment

#### Project Idea:

For my project, I wanted the analog & digital inputs to be somehow correlated. I came up with an idea where certain LEDs would only light up under specific circumstances. I used the potentiometer and a momentary switch and in order for some LEDs to light up, you would have to use both of them together. It's difficult to explain through words, so here is a [link to my video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jz5Vnds3Pdv6iFgkKXvAKkWOIPiCD8q_/view?usp=sharing)!



#### Struggles/ Issues:

I didn't run into any issues when it came to building the circuits, but I did have some trouble coming up with an idea. I couldn't quick think of a creative way to integrate both the analog & digital inputs, but last week's project inspired me and helped me come out wiht an idea after all.
